          I'm a college dropout who didn't like studying. Everything about
          studying rubbed me the wrong way.

      <h3>Journey as a reseller!</h3>
      <p>
        I first started in 2020 with buying some brick white huraches off of a
        25% Champs sale.
      </p>

      <p>
        Needless to say, these were a bad investment from the get go as I didn't
        do enough research.
      </p>
      <p>
        I barely made my money back, but by the time they sold I had already
        done enough research to join a cook group.
      </p>
      <p>
        To this day, I am in Endurance and have made around $10,000 in profits
        since 2020.
