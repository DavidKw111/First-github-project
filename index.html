        I should start with an introduction: I'm a college dropout who didn't
        like studying. Everything about studying rubbed me the wrong way. So, I
        decided to quit school and pursue whatever I wanted to. I'm grateful to
        have parents who are willing to support me with my decisions (although I
        image they're still not happy with it). One day I'll make them proud.

        <h3>Journey as a reseller!</h3>
        <p>
          I first started in 2020 with buying some brick white huraches off of a
          25% Champs sale.
        </p>
        Needless to say, these were a bad investment from the get go as I didn't
        do enough research. I barely made my money back, but by the time they
        sold I had already done enough research to join a cook group. To this
        day, I am in Endurance and have made around $10,000 in profits since
        2020.

            Over my 19 years of living I have consumed an ungodly amount of
            anime.

          the anime I have already seen!
